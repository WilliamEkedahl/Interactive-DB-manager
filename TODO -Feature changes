Everything is at a working stage now: 
FIRST FIX THE DATABASE so a student can be registered to multiple classes
1. Fix so that different messages give different colors Success messages = green and error messages = red currently only working for dataRemove-courses.php I don't know why lol.
2. Convert everything to use prepared statements
3. Make the error handling more consistent and better.
4. Improve the readability by making more functions, with priority being a function for the dynamic list boxes and then a function for removing data from the database + adding data to the database with error handling. 
4. Make the login screen safer + look better (styled with CSS).
5. Add Ajax real-time elements
6. Complete the logout screen.
7. Add more SQL search functions like sorting and more customized search 
8. Make a SQL search box where you can write custom SQL searches.
